/** \page qa Questions

\li The frame rate in the FRM files seems to be 8, which means 8 frames
per second, right?
- I think this is right.

\li RLE bug
- What's this?  I'm sending you a link to SV_LIB source that has a commented RLED

\li how fast is BzTimer?
- It's 5000 ms, or 5 seconds.  That stuff was handled by the Miles audio library to keep the audio buffer full.

\li what is DoCycle supposed to do?
- This is a little bit of color cycling on the space ports.  It's just shuffling some colors around
