/* Originally, the code relied upon tight struct packing, because
 * file data was read directly into the memory space of data structures.
 * An open-ended pragma was used to enforce tight packing. However,
 * this created several problems:
 *   - It caused problems in gamedata.h
 *   - Header files with structs/classes defined could be interpreted
 *   differently by code in multiple files, with one section of code
 *   treating the struct as packed and another as unpacked
 *   - It locks the structs/classes so they cannot be modified, which
 *   is inconvenient for major data types.
 *   - It dictated include ordering.
 *
 * If restoring tight packing, define ALTERED_STRUCTURE_PACKING as
 * some files - gamedata.h - do not like the tight packing and check
 * for ALTERED_STRUCTURE_PACKING to see if it is enabled.
